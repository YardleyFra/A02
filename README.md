2. **Open a Folder**: Click on the Explorer icon, and then 'Open Folder' to start working on a project.

### Step 3: Customize Settings

2. **Install a Theme**: In the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for themes and install one you like.

### Step 4: Install Extensions

2. **Install**: Search for extensions relevant to your needs (like Python, Git, etc.) and click 'Install'.

### Step 5: Create or Open a File

### Step 6: Write Code
1. **Edit**: Start typing your code in the editor.
2. **IntelliSense**: Use IntelliSense (autocomplete suggestions) to help you code more efficiently.

### Step 7: Use the Terminal

2. **Run Commands**: Execute commands as you would in any command-line interface.

### Step 8: Save Your Work
